""" 
Fast Food Sim!
Variables:

- Customer impatience
- Time it takes to process order

Scenario:
  This simulates a fast food restaurant's normal day. This restaurant can take 1-6 sim minutes
  to finish a meal. Sim minuites represent minuites in the simulation. But, the customer 
  has an impatience level that ranges from 3-6 which represents the amount of
  time they're willing to wait. If the impatience level is less than or equal to the wait
  then the customer leaves.
