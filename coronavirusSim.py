Disease Sim!
Variables:

-Amount of people infected
-Amount of countries infected
-Amount of people infected per day
-When the world creates a vaccine/cure

Scenario: 
A certian virus that may or may not start with a C has started infecting people in DC! 
Each day a number is chosen between 0 and 8. If that number is 3 then it spreads to one more country 
and the people infected per day is increased by one. If that number is over 5 then the people infected 
is multiplied by 2. If the number is 1, 2 or 4 then another country gets infected and the amount of 
people infected per day is increased by 1. By the 15 day point if the randomly drawn number is 1 then 
the world found a vaccine/cure and the people infected decreases by 5 every day.
